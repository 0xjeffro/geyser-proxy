# geyser-proxy


## Background
Develop a Solana account transaction subscription proxy based on the Yellowstone gRPC protocol to enable real-time data stream forwarding to downstream consumer systems. The system shall support seamless scaling from initial monitoring of a few contract addresses to enterprise-scale operations handling millions of accounts.

## System Characteristics
The system prioritizes data integrity over immediate configuration effectiveness, allowing up to 30 seconds for subscription updates to take effect.

## Design Objectives
- **Progressive Scalability:** Support smooth evolution from single-node to distributed cluster deployment
- **Hot Configuration Reload:** Enable subscription configuration hot-swapping while ensuring data stream continuity
- **High Availability:** Provide automatic fault recovery and connection reconstruction mechanisms
- **Automatic Sharding:** Intelligent distribution of subscription tasks across cluster nodes
- **P2P Synchronization:** Maintain state consistency across peer nodes

## Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility:** Focus exclusively on data subscription and forwarding without business logic processing
- **Fault Isolation:** Ensure individual connection or node failures do not impact overall service availability
- **Observability:** Provide comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing capabilities
